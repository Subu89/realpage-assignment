React Code Submission Application Requirements

Build a mobile-responsive web application that will fetch the Air Quality Index (AQI) scores from a free API.

https://openaq.org/

https://aqicn.org/

When the application is launched there should be a launch screen.
After the data is fetched from the API, the AQI should be presented to the user in a clean and concise manner.
The AQI data fetched should be determined by the userâ€™s location.
The user latitude and longitude should also be displayed along with the city name and weather station from which the data was fetched.
Bonus:

Display AQI information for one day prior and one day in the future.
The user could have the ability to enter another location from which to fetch AQI information.
Code can be placed in a public GitHub or shared via ZIP, ensure the node_modules is not included.
